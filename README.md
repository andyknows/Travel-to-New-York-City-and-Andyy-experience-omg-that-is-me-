New York City, is one of the most vibrant and iconic cities in the world. Known for its towering skyscrapers, diverse culture, and rich history, NYC offers endless opportunities for exploration and adventure. Experience the energy of Times Square, the tranquility of Central Park (and its smells), and the artistic flair of Broadway.

Things to See and my experience
Statue of Liberty - A symbol of freedom and democracy.
Central Park - An oasis of greenery in the heart of the city. (It smelled a bit bad, but there were a lot of people from different cultures there.)
Empire State Building - An iconic skyscraper with breathtaking views. (The stairs to go up were very narrow, so for a moment I had an attack of claustrophobia.)
Metropolitan Museum of Art - One of the largest and finest art museums in the world. (There were the artistic works of my favorite artist)
Times Square - The center of entertainment and bright lights. (Very noisy at night, but in the morning it's worth it)
Places to Go
Brooklyn Bridge - A incredible connection between Manhattan and Brooklyn. (The day I visited it rained a lot and it was very cold. At the end of the bridge, we expected to find keychain sellers, but we only found a hot dog stand after walking more than 2 km LOL. I still enjoyed it)
SoHo - A trendy neighborhood known for its shopping and art galleries (I guess).
Chinatown - A vibrant area full of authentic cuisine and cultural experiences. (The best in my opinion)
Fifth Avenue - Famous for luxury shopping and landmarks. (fr)
Broadway - Experience world-class theatre performances. (The most famous plays are always here)
One of the best experiences in my opinion, although I would change the fact that there are rats everywhere LOL
